* The next is an explanation given by Norton et.al. 2006 in which they shown why
they chosen the Fe I line centered at 6173 \AA to the HMI/SDO. An interesting
issue is said in the abstract where they say the follow:

"The one exception to the better performance of the Fe I line is when high 
field strengths combine with high velocities to move the spectral line beyond 
effective sampling range. The higher geff of FeI means that its useful range 
of velocity values in regions of strong magnetic field is smaller than Ni I."

It could be interesting trying to explain why we saw a blueshift in the June 
12, 2010 solar flare event.
